# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is part of the Data Science Nigeria Ladies in AI Mentorship Program.

## Description
A simple machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using the Kaggle Diabetes Dataset and Scikit-learn. It includes data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Dataset
- Kaggle Diabetes Dataset

## Steps Involved
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess and visualize data
3. Train a regression model
4. Evaluate performance using R² Score
5. Plot feature distributions

## How to Run
- Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab
- Run each cell in sequence
- Ensure required libraries are installed in the environment
